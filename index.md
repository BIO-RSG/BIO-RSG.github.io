## Overview

<b>The Satellite Ocean colour and Phytoplankton Ecology group (SOPhyE)</b> primarily works in the fields of biological oceanography, bio-optics, and satellite remote sensing of ocean colour, continuing the activities of the remote sensing group created in the late 90’s. SOPhyE’s expertise spans a wide spectrum from: 1) studying phytoplankton community structure on the Scotian Shelf and Labrador Sea, including the impacts of climate change; 2) developing satellite ocean colour algorithms to infer phytoplankton biomass, assemblage, and primary production in the Northwest Atlantic, and; 3) using high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery to derive coastal bottom-habitat types. SOPhyE’s work supports DFO’s mandate and several programs, such as the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP), the Atlantic Zone Off-Shelf Monitoring Program (AZOMP), the Bedford Basin Monitoring Program (BBMP), Marine Conservation Targets (MCT), Marine Spatial Planning (MSP), and fisheries management.
